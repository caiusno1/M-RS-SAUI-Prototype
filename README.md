# Consistent Runtime UI Adaptations (bachelor thesis)
## Is this project matured ?
No, it is not. I just currently writing my thesis. But some examples already work.
## How do you syncronize Context and UI?
I use a formalism called Triple Graph Grammar and implement it (more or less) in TypeScript/ Javascript.
## How to clone this repo ?
This repository uses a submodule (https://git-scm.com/book/de/v1/Git-Tools-Submodule) so there is additional work needed to clone this repository. Additional info therefore can be taken from the provided link. (Or just ask me ;-)).
For now only collaborators can access the TriggEngine submodule. If you wish to have an insight just contact me.
